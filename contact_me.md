# Get In Touch With Me

I cover cybercrime, nation-state threats, and election security for [CyberScoop](https://www.cyberscoop.com/). If you have something you think I should take a look at please don't hesitate to let me know. Each method of contact carries its own complications and level of anonymity. Please consider your risk level when reaching out. For instance, if sending sensitive materials your employer would not approve you sending, please don't use your work computer or phone.

## Secure Messaging

There are a variety of ways to call me directly, each with its own level of anonymity (or lackthereof). My direct number:

`810.206.9411`

Keep in mind that metadata associated with your call to me will be recorded by your phone provider (and mine). You can also send me SMS messages there but, again, the metadata associated with that SMS message will be plainly obvious.

### Signal

To message me anonymously and securely at the phone number above you can reach me via [Signal](https://signal.org/), a free app that provides end-to-end encryption. To prevent having to add me into your contacts on your phone, open the message and begin a new message and the service will find my phone number, allowing you to send your message. The service will not collect metadata about who you are contacting, only your phone number and the last time you accessed the service. If you're worried about me having your phone number consider using a different phone with the Signal app installed.

### Telegram

You can reach me on [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) at `@avicens_cs`

### WhatsApp

You can also reach me via WhatsApp at the same number above. The contents of the message will be encrypted end-to-end, but the metadata associated with the message will likely be retained by [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) (it is part of Facebook, after all).

## Email

You can email me directly at any time: `aj [dot] vicens [at] cyberscoop [dot] com`

Keep in mind that standard email records [a lot of information](https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204643950/understanding-an-email-header) about you and me (sender/receiver, time sent, from where, operating systems, etc.) In some cases the content of the email itself could be plainly visible to someone with the wherewithal to look for these sorts of things. If that's OK with you, go ahead and send me that email.


You can also find me at [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/), which offers end-to-end encryption *between ProtonMail users* for free: `aj_vicens [at] prontonmail [dot] com`.
