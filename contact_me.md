# Get In Touch With Me

I cover cybersecurity, national security, election security, technology, and data for [CyberScoop](https://www.cyberscoop.com/). If you have something you think I should take a look at please don't hesitate to let me know. Each method of contact carries its own complications and level of anonymity. Please consider your risk level when reaching out. For instance, if sending sensitive materials your employer would not approve you sending, please don't use your work computer or phone.

## Secure Messaging

There are a variety of ways to call me directly, each with its own level of anonymity (or lackthereof). My direct number:

`810.206.9411`

Keep in mind that metadata associated with your call to me will be recorded by your phone provider (and mine). You can also send me SMS messages there but, again, the metadata associated with that SMS message will be plainly obvious.

### Signal

To message me anonymously and securely at the phone number above you can reach me via [Signal](https://signal.org/), a free app that provides end-to-end encryption. To prevent having to add me into your contacts on your phone, open the message and begin a new message and the service will find my phone number, allowing you to send your message. The service will not collect metadata about who you are contacting, only your phone number and the last time you accessed the service. If you're worried about me having your phone number consider using a different phone with the Signal app installed.

### WhatsApp

You can also reach me via WhatsApp at the same number above. The contents of the message will be encrypted end-to-end, but the metadata associated with the message will likely be retained by [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) (it is part of Facebook, after all).

## Email

You can email me directly at any time: `aj [dot] vicens [at] cyberscoop [dot] com`

Keep in mind that standard email records [a lot of information](https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204643950/understanding-an-email-header) about you and me (sender/receiver, time sent, from where, operating systems, etc.) In some cases the content of the email itself could be plainly visible to someone with the wherewithal to look for these sorts of things. If that's OK with you, go ahead and send me that email.

You can send encrypted emails to this email address but, again, _**only the content**_ of the email will be encrypted. Subject lines, to/from, time/date, and other revealing information will still be transmitted openly for anyone who cares enough and has the means to look. If you still want to do this, attach your _**public**_ key to the email so I can use it to unlock the message. My fingerprint:

`8A3F 5FDC 719A D5AD F401  FF92 D7CE 581F 56E0 8029`

You can also find me at [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/), which offers end-to-end encryption *between ProtonMail users* for free: `aj_vicens [at] prontonmail [dot] com`.
